JS Analyzer is used to extract the URLs(ANY) from the list of Javascript files mentioned as URLs in separate file as js.txt (Too lazy to use OPTPARSE :) )

This can help in application security assessment by discovering additional functionalities and/or discovering internal IP addresses.

USAGE:

(1) Download the file
(2) Make sure you save all the Javascript URLs(Mention Absolute path) in js.txt file.
(3) Use Command: python JS_Analyzer.py js.txt
